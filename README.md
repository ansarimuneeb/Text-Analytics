Conclusion:

"Understanding which words occur most frequently in discussions about the brand can help identify what 
matters most to customers, whether it is the service, the quality of the product, or the efficiency of the 
delivery. Identifying frequent mentions of terms related to service and processes (like "return" and 
"delivery") might pinpoint areas needing improvement. Knowing that words like "quality" and "great" 
are common can guide the marketing strategy to highlight these aspects more prominently. The 
presence of words with potentially negative connotations ("not", "bad") for Brand Z_ could be crucial for 
sentiment analysis, indicating areas that may require attention or improvement. The frequent mention 
of "return" for both brands points to returns being a significant aspect of customer experience, possibly 
indicating dissatisfaction or an area where expectations are not met consistently. The usage of more 
direct-action words in Brand Z_ suggests possibly higher engagement in discussions around service 
interactions, which could be seen in both positive and negative lights."
